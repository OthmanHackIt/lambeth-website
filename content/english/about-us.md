Lambeth TechAid was organised in response to the Covid-19 lockdown, which amplified the digital divide.   Overnight, having access to a device and the internet became essential to communicate with friends & family, access educational resources and essential online services, and to combat isolation.  

We aim to help bridge the digital divide in Lambeth by supplying smart phones, tablets and laptops to children and adults who would not otherwise be able to obtain them.  

## What We Do
We collect unwanted devices, ensure all data is removed and they are in good working order, and then deliver them to local organisations such as schools, refugee and community groups to pass on to the people they work with who need them.

In order to respond to as broad a range of requests as possible, we ask that organisations limit each request to no more than 5 devices in total.  Following delivery of these, the requesting organisation is then welcome to submit another request for up to 5 more devices.  There is no limit to the number of requests they can submit but we ask that they wait for an outstanding request to be filled before submitting a further request.

## Who We Are
TechAid’s management group includes a retired LSE IT training specialist and charity trustee, a solicitor, a civil servant, IT professionals and more. We are all volunteering in a personal capacity. We do not have funding of any kind and depend on donations of devices and volunteers’ time to prepare and deliver mobiles, tablets and laptops to those who genuinely need them.  

The group met for the first time online on 23 March.  We now have more than 25 active volunteers, organised into 6 working groups: 

* **Technical**: remove data and update donated equipment
* **Transport**: collect and deliver devices 
* **Donations**: coordinate donations and assign them to the technical team
* **Distribution**: respond to and fill requests for devices
* **Publicity**: manage social media and other means to maintain a steady flow of donations and volunteers into TechAid
* **Management**: lead and coordinate the work of the various groups and the organisation as a whole

## Who Benefits
To date, we’ve had donations of more than 120 devices, with no end to the need in sight.  School students, young people leaving the care system, women identified by women's aid groups, housing association residents, refugees and families with “No Recourse to Public Funds'' all have received devices from us, and many more are in the pipeline.  All have been identified by local schools, charities and voluntary groups.   Additional requests from other organisations are in the queue, and we believe that there is considerable wider need for technology and internet amongst Lambeth’s diverse communities.
