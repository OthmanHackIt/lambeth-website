#### **About Us**

Lambeth TechAid came together in March 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the lockdown came into effect across the UK, many individuals were left without access to the internet. Existing inequalities have been amplified across the country as many everyday tasks and services have become accessible exclusively through online platforms, leaving many members of our community behind. Starting out as a small group of volunteers, LTA has since grown to 25 volunteers and has received upward of 220 devices. We work with local community driven organisations to ensure that these donations reach those who are in the most need.

Lambeth TechAid is proud to have Labour MP for Streatham, Bell Ribeiro-Addy as our Patron. Our work is supported with generosity from the [Walcot Foundation](lcotfoundation.org.uk), [Battersea Power Station Foundation](http://bpsfoundation.org.uk/) and [Lambeth  Forum Network](https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/about-lambeth/lambeth-forum-network).

#### What We Do

We collect devices people no longer need (principally computers, tablets and mobile phones), remove all data, ensure they are in good working order and deliver them to people in need, identified through local schools, women’s aid groups, disability, refugee and other community organisations. In Lambeth, where in 2016 there were an estimated 87,000 people living in poverty*, Lambeth TechAid can make a real difference. Through charitable donations from neighbours across the borough, we have been able to provide dozens of students and low income households with the devices they need to access the online world.

*“Thanks to donations some of our users have been able to face difficult isolation time studying English and taking part to online activities that support their connection with the community and help them to access the support services we provide”*

* Indoamerican Refugee and Migrant Organization

#### Structure

Lambeth TechAid’s Management Team is made up of individuals from across the borough who came together with a shared desire to help bridge the digital divide. They include a retired LSE IT training specialist and charity trustee, a Programme Manager, an Operations Manager for a major London museum, numerous IT professionals and a Chartered Account, among others, who are all volunteering in a personal capacity. 

The group met for the first time online on 23 March. We now have more than 25 active volunteers organised into 8 teams:

Management: Lead and coordinate the work of the various teams and the organisation as a whole

Donations: Coordinate device donations and assign them to technical team volunteers

Distribution: Respond to and fill requests for devices

Fundraising & Business Liaison: Network and build collaborative relationships with like-minded organisations; seek & pursue funding and donation leads

Publicity: Manage social media and other means to maintain a steady flow of donations and volunteers into TechAid, provide materials for fundraising and website content

Devices Technical: Remove all data from, and update, donated equipment

Volunteer Management & Transport: Ensure new volunteers are trained, inducted and supported; manage collection and delivery of devices

Website & Database: Maintain and further develop our website and database

#### Who Benefits

To date, we’ve had donations of more than 220 devices, with no end to the need in sight. Recipients are identified by local schools, charities and voluntary groups.  Students, young people leaving the care system, women identified by women’s aid groups, housing association residents, refugees and families with “No Recourse to Public Funds*’’ all have received devices from us. Many more requests are in the pipeline. Additional requests from other organisations are in the queue, and we believe that there is a considerably wider need for technology and internet access amongst Lambeth’s diverse communities.

We have fulfilled or are considering requests for devices from the following organisations on behalf of households they work with:

In order to respond to as broad a range of requests as possible, we ask that organisations limit each request to no more than 5 devices in total. Following delivery of these, the requesting organisation is then welcome to submit another request for up to 5 more devices. There is no limit to the number of requests they can submit but we ask that they wait for an outstanding request to be filled before submitting a further request.

\*No recourse to public funds (NRPF) is a term used for people who are subject to immigration control and have no entitlement to welfare benefits, to home office asylum support for asylum seekers or to public housing.  They include families with young children and vulnerable young people with nowhere to turn.
