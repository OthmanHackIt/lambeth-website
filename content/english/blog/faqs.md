Our frequently asked questions with regards to donations and how we process them. 
If none of the answers here answer your query, feel free to email us. 


## Does the device have to be working

Yes. We do not have the capacity to fix devices. We will be doing a fresh install on the donated tech, so it needs to be able to start OK and run without too many problems before we do that install.

## My device is working, but it seems to be slow / have some problems. Do you still want it?

Yes, probably! Much tech can work perfectly reasonably with a fresh install. Please fill in the donation form with as much detail as possible about the tech you have. We will then be in touch about whether we think we can use it, and if so to arrange collection.

## I’ve lost the power charger. Do you still want it?

Possibly. Please fill in the donation form with as much detail as possible about the tech you have. We will decide whether to take it depending on its overall condition and spec, and the ease and cost of replacing the charger. We will then be in touch about whether we think we can use it, and if so to arrange collection.

## How do you decide who gets the tech, and what tech they get?	

We work with local schools and voluntary organisations to ensure that donated mobiles, tablets and computers go to people who genuinely need them.  

## My device is working, but the screen is broken. Do you still want it?

No. Unfortunately we don’t have the resources to repair devices.  However, charger plugs & cables and laptop power converters & leads are very helpful as many devices are donated without them.

## Can I get donated devices direct from you?

No, we cannot deal with individual requests. If you are in need of technology and do not currently have any, or know someone who is in this situation, please ask their school or other community organisation to contact us

## Will you collect the device or do I need to drop it off?

It depends on the condition of the device you wish to donate. Please complete the donation form with as much detail as possible.  If the device needs no further assessment and it is possible for you to drop it off, we will provide you with details of the drop off point in Streatham.   If it needs to be assessed by our tech experts, or if it isn't possible for you to drop off the device, we will be in touch to arrange a suitable time and day for collection.

## How do I know if you can use my device?

The best way to find out is by completing our device donation simple form with as much detail as possible.  We try to reply within 7 days.

When it comes to iPhones, we can use iPhone 5 and up. The iPhone 4 and earlier can no longer be properly update, so are open to many vulnerabilities.  However, we would very much appreciate their charger plugs, which can be used with later models.

We cannot repair or replace cracked or damaged screens.  Similarly, if a device cannot be turned on we will be unable to use it.  However, charger cables and plugs, and computer power converters and leads in good condition are very helpful as many devices are donated without them.
