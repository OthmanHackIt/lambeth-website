- question: Does the device have to be working
  answer: |- 
    Yes. We do not have the capacity to fix devices. We will be doing a fresh install on the donated tech, so it needs to be able to start OK and run without too many problems before we do that install.
- question: My device is working, but it seems to be slow / have some problems. Do you still want it?
  answer: |- 
    Yes, probably! Much tech can work perfectly reasonably with a fresh install. Please fill in the donation form with as much detail as possible about the tech you have. We will then be in touch about whether we think we can use it, and if so to arrange collection.
- question: I’ve lost the power charger. Do you still want it?
  answer: |- 
    Possibly. Please fill in the donation form with as much detail as possible about the tech you have. We will decide whether to take it depending on its overall condition and spec, and the ease and cost of replacing the charger. We will then be in touch about whether we think we can use it, and if so to arrange collection.
- question: My device is working, but the screen is broken. Do you still want it?
  answer: |- 
    No. Unfortunately we don’t have the resources to repair devices. However, charger plugs & cables and laptop power converters & leads are very helpful as many devices are donated without them.
- question: How do I know if you can use my device?
  answer: |- 
    The best way to find out is by completing our device donation simple form with as much detail as possible. We try to reply within 7 days.

    When it comes to iPhones, we can use iPhone 5 and up. The iPhone 4 and earlier can no longer be properly update, so are open to many vulnerabilities. However, we would very much appreciate their charger plugs, which can be used with later models.

    We cannot repair or replace cracked or damaged screens. Similarly, if a device cannot be turned on we will be unable to use it. However, charger cables and plugs, and computer power converters and leads in good condition are very helpful as many devices are donated without them.
