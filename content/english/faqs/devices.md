  - question: Does the device have to be working?  How do I know if you want it?
    answer: >-
      The best way to find out is by completing this simple
      **[form](https://lambeth-techaid.ju.ma/donate-device)** with as much
      detail as possible. We try to reply within 7 days.


      We will be doing a fresh install on donated devices, so they need to be able to start OK and run without too many problems when we receive them.  However, even computers which cannot be turned on often have useful parts we can use on other devices.


      When it comes to iPhones, we can use iPhone 5 and up. (We also accept iPhone 4 but distribute them for use only as basic mobiles for phoning and sending text messages.  This is because because they can no longer be properly updated, so are open to many vulnerabilities.) 


      If a mobile or tablet screen is cracked but usable, we'll be happy to consider it.  However, we cannot repair or replace smashed or damaged screens. Similarly, if a mobile or tablet cannot be turned on we will be unable to use it. However, charger cables and plugs, and computer power converters and leads in good condition are very helpful as many devices are donated without them.
  - question: My device is working, but it seems to be slow / has some problems. Do
      you still want it?
    answer: Very probably, yes! Many devices can work perfectly reasonably with a
      fresh install. Please fill in the donation [form
      ](https://lambeth-techaid.ju.ma/app/donate-device)with as much detail as
      possible. We will then be in touch about whether we think we can use it
      and, if so, to arrange collection or delivery to one of our drop off
      points.
  - question: Iâ€™ve lost the power charger. Do you still want it?
    answer: Very probably, yes!  Please fill in the device donation [**form**
      ](https://lambeth-techaid.ju.ma/app/donate-device)with as much detail as
      possible. We will decide whether to take it depending on its overall
      condition and spec, and the ease and cost of replacing the charger. We
      will then be in touch about whether we think we can use it and, if so, to
      arrange collection or delivery to one of our drop off points.
  - question: "I have some redundant charger cables, a mouse and a computer monitor,
      USB sticks and other bits and pieces.  Do you want them? "
    answer: >-
      We can make good use of any bits and pieces that are used with mobiles,
      tablets and any type of computer, such as:


      * charging cables

      * computer power adapters

      * webcams

      * speakers

      * computer monitors

      * mice (wired or wireless but not the kind that eat cheese, please!)

      * keyboards

      * USB sticks and external hard drives

      * headphones

      * microphones

      * laptop or tablet cases

      * printers

      * assistive technology devices of any kind
  - question: Can I just drop off the tech I want to donate?  Do I have to fill in
      the online form?
    answer: >-
      Completing the form saves us much more time than it takes you, so we
      really appreciate it when people use it.  Whether or not you complete the
      form, you can drop off device donation(s) at either of the locations
      below.  Please ensure you follow these simple steps:


      1. **BEFORE YOU DROP OFF:** Please remove any iPhone, iPad or Apple Mac computer from your iCloud account.  It would also be very helpful if you remove any password from any device you donate.

      2. Put your donation(s), including any charging cables or other bits, into one of the bags provided.

      3. Complete the short paper form provided, including any password that might be on the device. *(If you're not sure, please put down as many guesses as possible!)*  Please also provide contact details so we can get in touch with any questions if needed, and let you know where your device found a new home.

      4. Put the form into the bag with your donation, tie it closed and leave it in the box provided.

  - question: What do I do about the data I have on my device?
    answer: Our volunteer tech experts wipe all data from every device before it is
      given to someone in need.  However, if you wish to delete data and/or
      factory reset your device before you donate it to us, you can find a
      number of online guides to do so. For instance, there is**
      [this](https://computing.which.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/208270025-How-to-factory-reset-a-computer)**
      Which? Guide for Windows computers and Chromebooks,
      **[this](https://support.google.com/android/answer/6088915?hl=en-GB)**
      guide for Android phones,
      **[this](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201065)** guide from Apple for
      Macs and **[this](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201252)** one for
      iPhones and iPads.
