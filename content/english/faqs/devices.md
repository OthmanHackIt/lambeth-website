  - question: Does the device have to be working?  How do I know if you want it?
    answer: >-
      The best way to find out is by completing this simple
      **[form](https://lambeth-techaid.ju.ma/donate-device)** with as much
      detail as possible. We try to reply within 7 days.


      We will be doing a fresh install on donated devices, so they need to be able to start OK and run without too many problems before we do that install.  However, even computers which cannot be turned on often have useful parts we can use on other devices.


      When it comes to iPhones, we can use iPhone 5 and up.  We accept  iPhone 4 but distribute them for use only as basic mobiles for phoning and sending text messages.  This is because because they can no longer be properly update, so are open to many vulnerabilities. 


      If a mobile or tablet screen is cracked but usable, we'll be happy to consider it.  However, we cannot repair or replace smashed or damaged screens. Similarly, if a mobile or tablet cannot be turned on we will be unable to use it. However, charger cables and plugs, and computer power converters and leads in good condition are very helpful as many devices are donated without them.
  - question: My device is working, but it seems to be slow / has some problems. Do
      you still want it?
    answer: Very probably, yes! Much tech can work perfectly reasonably with a fresh
      install. Please fill in the donation form with as much detail as possible
      about the tech you have. We will then be in touch about whether we think
      we can use it and, if so, to arrange collection or delivery to one of our
      drop off points.
  - question: Iâ€™ve lost the power charger. Do you still want it?
    answer: Very probably, yes!  Please fill in the device donation[**form**
      ](https://lambeth-techaid.ju.ma/app/donate-device)with as much detail as
      possible. We will decide whether to take it depending on its overall
      condition and spec, and the ease and cost of replacing the charger. We
      will then be in touch about whether we think we can use it and, if so, to
      arrange collection or delivery to one of our drop off points.
