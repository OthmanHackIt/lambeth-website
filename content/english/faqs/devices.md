  - question: Does the device have to be working?  How do I know if you want it?
    answer: >-
      The best way to find out is by completing this simple
      **[form](https://lambeth-techaid.ju.ma/donate-device)** with as much
      detail as possible. We try to reply within 7 days.


      We will be doing a fresh install on donated devices, so they need to be able to start OK and run without too many problems before we do that install.  However, even computers which cannot be turned on often have useful parts we can use on other devices.


      When it comes to iPhones, we can use iPhone 5 and up. (We also accept iPhone 4 but distribute them for use only as basic mobiles for phoning and sending text messages.  This is because because they can no longer be properly update, so are open to many vulnerabilities.) 


      If a mobile or tablet screen is cracked but usable, we'll be happy to consider it.  However, we cannot repair or replace smashed or damaged screens. Similarly, if a mobile or tablet cannot be turned on we will be unable to use it. However, charger cables and plugs, and computer power converters and leads in good condition are very helpful as many devices are donated without them.
  - question: My device is working, but it seems to be slow / has some problems. Do
      you still want it?
    answer: Very probably, yes! Much tech can work perfectly reasonably with a fresh
      install. Please fill in the donation form with as much detail as possible
      about the tech you have. We will then be in touch about whether we think
      we can use it and, if so, to arrange collection or delivery to one of our
      drop off points.
  - question: Iâ€™ve lost the power charger. Do you still want it?
    answer: Very probably, yes!  Please fill in the device donation[**form**
      ](https://lambeth-techaid.ju.ma/app/donate-device)with as much detail as
      possible. We will decide whether to take it depending on its overall
      condition and spec, and the ease and cost of replacing the charger. We
      will then be in touch about whether we think we can use it and, if so, to
      arrange collection or delivery to one of our drop off points.
  - question: "I have some redundant cables, mice, a computer monitor, USB sticks,
      an external hard drive and other bits and pieces.  Do you want them? "
    answer: >-
      We can make good use of any bits and pieces that are used with mobiles,
      tablets and any type of computer, such as:


      * charging cables

      * computer power adapters

      * webcams

      * speakers

      * computer monitors

      * mice (wired or wireless but not the kind that eat cheese, please!)

      * keyboards

      * USB sticks

      * headphones

      * microphones

      * laptop or tablet cases

      * printers

      * assistive technology devices of any kind
  - question: Can I just drop off the tech I want to donate?  Do I have to fill in
      the online form?
    answer: >-
      Completing the form saves us much more time than it takes you, so we
      really appreciate it when people use it.  Whether or not you complete the
      form, you can drop off device donation(s) at either of the locations
      below.  Please ensure you follow these simple steps:


      1. Put your donation(s), including any charging cables or other bits, into one of the bags provided.


      2. Complete the short paper form provided, including contact details in case we need a password or other basic info from you.


      3. Put the form into the bag with your donation, tie it closed and leave it in the box provided.

  - question: Can you collect my donation?
    answer: Yes, please fill in the **[form
      ](https://lambeth-techaid.ju.ma/app/donate-device)**and let us know that
      you need us to collect your donation.  Please provide a mobile number so
      that we can get in touch to arrange this.
  - question: What do I do about the data I have on my device?
    answer: We will ensure all data is fully wiped from every device by our
      volunteer tech experts before it is given to someone in need.  However, if
      you wish to delete data and/or factory reset your device before you donate
      it to us, you can find a number of online guides to do so. For instance,
      there is
      **[this](https://computing.which.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/208270025-How-to-factory-reset-a-computer)**
      Which? Guide for Windows computers and Chromebooks,
      **[this](https://support.google.com/android/answer/6088915?hl=en-GB)**
      guide for Android phones,
      **[this](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201065)** guide from Apple for
      Macs and **[this](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201252)** one for
      iPhones and iPads
