- question: How do you decide who gets the tech, and what tech they get?
  answer: |- 
    We work with local schools and voluntary organisations to ensure that donated mobiles, tablets and computers go to people who genuinely need them.
- question: Can I get donated devices direct from you?
  answer: |- 
    No, we cannot deal with individual requests. If you are in need of technology and do not currently have any, or know someone who is in this situation, please ask their school or other community organisation to contact us
- question: Will you collect the device or do I need to drop it off?
  answer: |- 
    It depends on the condition of the device you wish to donate. Please complete the donation form with as much detail as possible. If the device needs no further assessment and it is possible for you to drop it off, we will provide you with details of the drop off point in Streatham. If it needs to be assessed by our tech experts, or if it isnâ€™t possible for you to drop off the device, we will be in touch to arrange a suitable time and day for collection.
