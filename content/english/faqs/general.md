draft: true

items:
  - question: How do you decide who gets the tech, and what tech they get?
    answer: We work with local schools and voluntary organisations to ensure that
      donated mobiles, tablets and computers go to people who genuinely need
      them.
  - question: Can I get donated devices direct from you?
    answer: No, we cannot deal with individual requests. If you are in need of
      technology and do not currently have any, or know someone who is in this
      situation, please ask their school or other community organisation to
      contact us
